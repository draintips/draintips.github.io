*Optimizing the neurosphere of work involves improving the DEEP flow and reflow of the play of a recursive game* ... *** realizing that the game itself is an ecosystem that is learning, adapting, getting smarter and might even be trying to play you.*** 

**SIMPLIFICATION of impossibly tough problems is ALL in the mind.** We can think about applying the [Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) for Deep Recursive AI Neural Networks ... but we should not forget about the law of unintended consequences which applies to any brilliant solution.

Developers have to ditch the cleverness that clogging their codebases ... but doing this requires admitting that code does not flow ... and THE REASON for that lack of flow is that the DRAIN developer has tried to stuff too much long hair down the ***gitpipe***.

# What's a ***gitpipe***?

Let's re-read [Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) with some additional focus on [Git Internals - Plumbing and Porcelain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) ... approach this whole thing from a different perspective, with some serious thought given to how we might reduce just shoving things down the gitpipe just because the thing will swallow anything we commit.

A ***gitpipe*** is nothing but a likely to be thrown away git ***branch*** that has been created for the sole purpose of staging a soft, mushy, still WORK-IN-PROCESS-EY ***commit*** ... we might want several ***gitpipes*** to hold several different ideas ... but the GOAL of the final master commit is a radically SIMPLER, SMALLER, TIGHTER ***commit*** that make future code more maintainable, more likely to flow. ALWAYS BE SIMPLIFYING the alternative ***gitpipes*** with an eye to selecting the very simplest, tightest, most solid code ... you don't want lots of hair or stringey fur in your code, because *you will get enough of that stuff without trying*.

# DeepGit is for unclogging clogged ***gitpipes***

What if ML/AI actually made things radically simpler?

HOW does the subconscious process things into a simpler concepts that the conscious mind insists upon making more complex ... what if we could use ML/AI to subconsciously simplify the code we write?
