Large language models are largely about cliches ... for example, if you sniff the stuff that Copilot suggests, you will sniff something that is likely to be a stinking, feature-rich, stale cliches that has been krausening itself in the grease trap of the large language model bin. The only thing that you really know about these cliches is that they are likely to be ALMOST useful, but overall, your code will need to refactored, simplified, and depleted of tendency to just add a clever, unnecessary feature.

The secret sauce of DRAIN.tips lies in how we simplify clogs of code ... *partly by sniffing it* ... but, MOSTLY, by recognizing that it simply does not really FLOW and it needs to be refactored in order to get to the MVP (minimum viable product) or the FOCUS of the thing users are really trying to accomplish ... without those *interesting* strands of features which clog drains like long hair.  MOSTLY, it's about recognizing the FALLACY that the developer's cleverness should be allow to go untrimmed, into the nether, never checked realms of a codebase.
