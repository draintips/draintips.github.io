What follows below is a high-level outline [suggested by Claude AI](https://claude.ai/chat/e3abec2a-ce0f-4dfb-8783-fe8437153fdc) for a 200-module syllabus for autodidactic immersive study of topics necessary for the engineering analysis of viscoelastic material flow, with a focus on anisotropic biological materials, especially human sewage which includes things like hair and all kinds of flushed surprises.

Developing this syllabus is essentially the first thing that an autodidact must learn how to do. This includes finding affordable resources such as Wolfram Alpha and Mathematic, but it also involves things like competing open-source resources, such as pre-print archives, online knowledge bases, and Wikipedia, to supplement the learning material. This means that the modern autodidact has to be comfortable being something of a polyglot ... familiar with different affordable software tools, such as Mathematica (with a monthly subscription), Python libraries, and Jupyter notebooks ... before moving on to more expensive multiphysics CAD tools for implementation and numerical simulations.

To gain hands-on experience, developing the syllabus will also involve searching for relevant projects or volunteer opportunities with organizations like Engineers Without Borders, focusing on the design, analysis, and improvement of systems involving viscoelastic flow and biological materials. The autodidact will use time as it's availble to allow for loosely-structured, but self-paced learning, with a balance between theoretical concepts and practical applications. Self-assessments can include problem sets, coding assignments, case studies, and design projects, with an emphasis on developing a deep understanding of the subject matter and applying it to real-world challenges.

Throughout the syllabus, connections should be made between the various topics, exploring the interdisciplinary nature of the field and the importance of integrating knowledge from multiple domains to solve complex problems in the engineering analysis of viscoelastic material flow, particularly in the context of human sewage and biological materials.

## I. Mathematical Foundations (40 modules)

This is a good opportunity to use BOTH Mathematica and Python libraries with Jupyter notebooks to explore the concepts of calculus and advanced calculus, including limits, derivatives, integrals, series, and sequences. This will also involve exploring multivariable calculus, vector calculus, and differential equations, with a focus on applications to engineering problems.

### A. Calculus and Advanced Calculus (8 modules)

We start with [Wolfram U](https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/certifications/)'s [Introduction to Calculus](https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/courses/mathematics/introduction-to-calculus/), in part, just to get familiar with Mathematica Notebooks and Wolfram Alpha. 

[Lesson 1: What Is Calculus](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/online-courses/introduction-to-calculus/what-is-calculus.html) ... calculus is the science of change, originally developed to solve four main problems: 1) Finding a tangent line to a curve, 2) Calculating the area under a curve, 3) Investigating the velocity of a particle given either its position or acceleration, 4) Optimizing a process by finding the corresponding function's maxima and minima.

[Lesson 2: Functions](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/online-courses/introduction-to-calculus/functions.html) is about showing how to precisely define change in quantity with respect to some other quantity (or quantities) using the Wolfram Language. 
A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set A exactly one element, called f[x], in a set B. The value f[x] is called the value of f at x and is usually read as “f of x.”
